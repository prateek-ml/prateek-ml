### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Prateek Bhardwaj** (you can call me Patrick, though) and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. I have a sort of expertise in Python and C++. Currently, I am working on Computer Vision applications in Python and learning about the same.
I describe myself as a Computer geek (sometimes I'm also a Stats nerd). I will also be working on developing Flutter mobile applications very soon.

If you liked my profile and my work sample, please consider hiring me. You can contact me @ **prateekb1912@gmail.com**
